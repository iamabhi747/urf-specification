# Unified Report Format (URF)

## Core Purpose
URF is a standardization specification for medical reports that provides a unified structure for all types of medical data - from routine blood tests to complex surgical reports, ensuring consistency in data representation and units across different medical contexts.

## Dual Format System
The specification exists in two complementary formats:
- **URFe (Electronic)**: A structured data format with .urfe extension
- **URFv (Visual)**: A PDF-based format with LaTeX embeddings and authenticated QR codes

## Universal Application
The format is designed to be comprehensive enough to standardize any type of medical report, making it a universal converter for medical documentation regardless of the source or complexity.

## Data Standardization
Implements consistent data fields and measurement units across all medical reports, ensuring compatibility and reducing confusion between different healthcare providers and systems.
